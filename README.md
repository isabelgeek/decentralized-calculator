# DECENTRALIZED CALCULATOR

What is a decentralized ecosystem without a calculator? Absolutely nothing.
Maybe you need to calculate your token benefits, your storage fees,...your taxes.

Here it is a decentralized calculator...the resurrection of the calculator that you will never pull from blockchain.

## How to build the HTML
To build the HTML you can use the npm package `inliner`.
Run the following commands and you will end up with a `dist.html` that contains everything required to upload to Skynet.

```
npm install -g inliner
cat index.html | inliner > dist.html 
```
Upon uploading a file, Skynet generates a 46 byte link called a Skylink.
